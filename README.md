### Basic Overview

I am thrilled to present a chatbot project developed using React Expo, a powerful framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.
The chatbot interface allows users to input messages or queries, while the real-time conversational display ensures a seamless user experience. 
The integration with the Google Palm API introduces cutting-edge natural language processing and machine learning features, enhancing the chatbot's ability to understand and respond intelligently.
